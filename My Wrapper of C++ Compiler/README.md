# My Wrapper of C++ Compiler.

- Having to compile, run and debug every time is a very cumbersome task.


## Features

- `-Wall` and `-Wextra` enabled by default. (Easier to find bugs!)

- Seperating of **Compiler** and **Linker**. (Sometimes it is an error of the linker rather than the compiler!)

- Automatically guess the name of source file. (Quite often would there be more than one files starting with the same prefix, eg. `test.out` and `test.cpp`. This saves some keystrokes!)

- On succeed, run the program directly. (Integrated workflow!)


## Installation

- Simply put this file under your `~/bin` folder and grant it execution privilege.
