# My Wrapper of C++ Compiler.

- Having to compile, run and debug every time is a very cumbersome task.


## Features

- `Wall` and `Wextra` enabled by default (easier to find bugs!)

- Seperation of **Compiler** and **Linker** (sometimes it is an error of the linker rather than the compiler)

- Automatically guess the name of source file (quite often would there be more than one files starting with the same prefix, eg. `test.out` and `test.cpp`)

- On succeed, run the program directly (integrated workflow!)


## Installation

- Put this file under your `~/bin` folder.
